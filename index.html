                I, Dalinar Kholin, write this in hopes that this will be seen by all who wish
                to defend that which they love against the forces of evil. I'm the leader of an ancient
                group known as the Knights Radiant. We are ten distinct orders of men and women who swear
                powerful oaths and gain extraordinary abilities to defend our world from a rising threat
                called the God of Passion, or Odium and his army of powerful Singers, a super race unlike
                anything anyone has seen before. Odium seeks the destruction of Roshar and all Humankind.
                Our purpose as Knights Radiant is to stop them. Every order has its own purpose: protectors,
                scouts, healers, scholars, diplomats, and warriors alike, all united in the defense of Roshar,
                but all are bound by ideals of responsibility, honor, and improvement. In this record, you will
                learn what each order stands for, what qualities its members must embody, and how its strengths
                contribute to our survival. Some orders have grown strong; others are in dire need of new recruits.
                If you feel the desire to protect, to build, to lead, or simply to become better than you were
                before, then there may be a place for you among the Knights Radiant. Come and unite with us,
                for the good of all.

                Urithiru is the heart of the Knights Radiant—a towering city carved into the peaks where the air
                is clear, and the mind can rise unhindered. Here, the ten orders once trained, studied, and
                governed together, each contributing their strengths for the good of all. Its halls hold room
                for learning, strategy, rest, and reflection, and its height reminds us that the Radiants must 
                always strive upward in purpose and character. Should you take up the ideals and join us, Urithiru 
                will stand as your home, your refuge, and a place where you may become the person you were meant 
                to be.
