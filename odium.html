        <p id="about-odium">
            Odium is not just a villain, but a vast, godlike force driven by pure, unyielding hatred. He is the god of the singers, and he grants his eternal warriors, the Fused, new life again and again so they may continue his war. Odium has shattered other divine powers before and seeks to reshape the world by making passion without restraint the ruling principle of all things. If you stand as Radiants, know that he is not just an enemy of humanity, but of any path that values honor, connection, or compassion over conquest and domination.

        <p id="about-singers">
            The singers are Roshar's original people, a proud and ancient race who communicate their emotions with songs. There skin is more like shell, decorated with red, black or white patterns, that grows from and protects them. Most follow Odium as their god. He offers them passion, purpose, and the promise of taking back what they believe was lost, and their immortal champions—the Fused—return from death again and again to fight in his name. They are not monsters, but a people with their own history and wounds, yet many now stand beneath Odium's banner, and if you become Radiants, they are the foes you will most often face, even as we hope one day for peace.

        <p id="about-fused">
            The Fused are ancient singer warlords made immortal by Odium, wielding powers similar to Radiants but granted by his direct will rather than oaths. When slain, their souls return and can take new bodies, letting them fight across ages with unmatched experience. They are seasoned, determined, and convinced Odium is their rightful god—formidable foes you will face if you choose the path of the Radiant.
